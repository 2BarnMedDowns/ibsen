OOOOooook... 

So basicly! to compile python modules from c/c++ and have them imported from CPython interpreter 
you need to have some stuff... 

1. python develop header and libraries, onm linux these packages are called 
    ubuntu: sudo apt-get install python-dev
    fedora: yum install python-devel 
    etc...

2. link with libpython2.7.whatever, find it! and link it!

3. need Python.h header file (it comes with the packages aswell) find it and include it in the compilaer stage.

4. On every sane system, the produced binary is a dynamically linked library (.so) except on windows where its a dynamically linked library but not called .dll, its called .pyd ... because adobe terms
   (if you make a <my_module.dll> on windows it wont find it, the interpreter looks for <my_module.pyd> rename acordingly

5. place it in the folder of the python file or specify LD_PRELOAD accordingly (except windows)



gcc -shared main.c -I/usr/include/python2.7 -I../include -lpython2.7 -o ibsen.so
